    1a. Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider referred to in paragraph 1, when it is not eligible for the limited liability provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC, shall not be liable for unauthorised acts of communication to the public and acts of making available provided that it

    (a) takes effective measures to prevent the availability on its services of unauthorised works or other subject-matter identified by rightholders, and

    (b) upon notification by rightholders of a specific unauthorised work or other subject matter, acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the specific unauthorised work or other subject matter and prevent its future availability through the measures referred to in sub-paragraph (a).

    Where rightholders have not provided the online content sharing service provider data on unauthorised works or other subject-matter to be prevented through the application of the measures referred to in sub-paragraph (a), an online content sharing service provider which have taken such measures shall not be liable for the unauthorised acts of communication to the public and acts of making available of these works and other subject matter.

2. Member States shall provide that that the measures referred to in paragraph 1a (a) and the action taken following a notification by rightholders referred to in paragraph 1a (b) shall be implemented by an online content sharing service provider without prejudice to the freedom of expression and information of their users and the possibility for the users to benefit from an exception or limitation to copyright. For that purpose the service provider shall put in place a complaint and redress mechanism that is available to users of the service in case of disputes over the application of the measures. Complaints submitted under this mechanism shall be processed in collaboration with rightholders within a reasonable period of time. This mechanism shall allow the preliminarily blocked content to be made publicly available until the parties agree on the action to follow or the complaint is otherwise dealt with. Relevant rightholders shall be appropriately notified about these uploads to allow them to enforce their rights with regard to infringing works or other subject matter, as appropriate.

Member States shall provide that licencing agreements concluded between online content sharing service providers and relevant rightholders, shall cover the acts of the users of the services falling within Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC and Article 8 (2) of Directive 2006/115/EC, when the users are not acting in a professional capacity.
