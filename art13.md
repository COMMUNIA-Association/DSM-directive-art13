This subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to exceptions and limitations provided for in Union law.
	
	Member States shall provide that when an authorisation has been obtained, including via a licensing agreement, by an online content sharing service provider, this authorisation shall also cover acts of uploadings of the users of the service falling within Article 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC when they are not acting on a commercial basis.

3. When an online content sharing service provider performs an act of communication to the public or an act of making available to the public, it shall not be eligible for the exemption of liability provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC for unauthorised acts of communication to the public and making available to the public, without prejudice to the possible application of Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC to those services for purposes other than copyright relevant acts.

4. In the absence of the authorisation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider shall not be liable for acts of communication to the public or making available to the public within the meaning of this Article when:

    (a) it demonstrates that it has made best efforts to prevent the availability of specific works or other subject matter  by implementing effective and proportionate measures, in accordance with paragraph 5, to prevent the availability on its services of the specific works or other subject matter identified by rightholders and for which the rightholders have provided the service with information for the application of these measures; and

    (b) upon notification by rightholders of works or other subject matter, it has acted expeditiously to remove or disable access to these works or other subject matter and it demonstrates that it has made its best efforts to prevent their future availability through the measures referred to in point (a).

5. The measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 shall be effective and proportionate, taking into account, among other factors:

    (a) the nature and size of the services, including their audience;

    (b) the amount and the type of works or other subject matter uploaded by the
users of the services;

    (c) the availability and costs of the measures as well as their effectiveness in light of technological developments in line with the industry best practice referred to in paragraph 8.

6. Online content sharing service providers shall provide rightholders, at their request, with adequate information on the deployment and functioning of the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 to allow the assessment of their effectiveness, in particular information on the type of measures used and, where licensing agreements are concluded between service providers and rightholders, information on the use of content covered by the agreements.

7. Member States shall ensure that the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 are implemented by the online content sharing service provider without prejudice to the possibility for their users to benefit from exceptions or limitations to copyright. For that purpose, the service provider shall put in place a complaint and redress mechanism that is available to users of the service in case of disputes over the application of the measures to their content. Complaints submitted under this mechanism shall be processed by the online content sharing service provider in cooperation with relevant rightholders within a reasonable period of time. Rightholders shall duly justify the reasons for their requests to remove or block access to their specific works or other subject matter.

8. The Commission and the Member States shall encourage stakeholder dialogues to define best practices for the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4. The Commission shall, in consultation with online content sharing service providers, rightholders and other relevant stakeholders, issue guidance on the application of the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4.
