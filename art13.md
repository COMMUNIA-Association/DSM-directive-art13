## Article 13 Use of protected content by online content sharing service providers

-1. Without prejudice to Article 3(1) and (2) of the Directive 2001/29/EC, online content sharing service providers perform an act of communication to the public and shall conclude fair and appropriate licensing agreements with right holders that so request. Such licensing agreements concluded by the online content sharing service providers with rights holders shall cover the liability for works uploaded by the users of their services, where such users do not act for commercial purposes or are not the right holder or his representative.

1. The online content sharing service providers referred to in paragraph -1 shall, in cooperation with right holders, take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure the functioning of licensing agreements concluded with right holders for the use of their works or other subject-matter on those services.

      In the absence of licensing agreements with right holders, online content sharing service providers shall ensure the non- availability of, or remove expeditiously from their services, copyright-protected works, or other subject matter, that are identified by right holders, and shall take appropriate and proportionate measures to prevent future availability of such works or other subject matter. Any measures taken for this purpose by service providers shall not prevent the availability of non- infringing or non-identified copyright- protected works or other subject matter, including such content covered by a copyright exception.

      Member States shall ensure that the online content sharing service providers shall apply such measures based on the relevant information provided by right holders. To ensure the effective functioning of those measures, right holders shall provide the online content sharing service provider with such information.

      The online content sharing service providers shall inform right holders, in a transparent manner, of the measures employed, their implementation, and where relevant, shall periodically report on the use of the works and other subject- matter.

      Member States shall ensure that the implementation of any measures as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be proportionate, taking into account, among others, the nature and size of the services, the availability of technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments, shall strike a balance between the fundamental rights of users and right holders, including those enshrined in exceptions and limitations provided for in Union law and the rights set out in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, in accordance with Article15 of Directive 2000/31/EC, where applicable, shall not impose a general obligation on online content sharing service providers to monitor the information which they transmit or store.

2. To prevent misuses of, or restrictions to, the exercise of exceptions and limitations to copyright law, Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 put in place effective and expeditious complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the application of the measures referred to in paragraph 1. Any complaint filed under such mechanisms shall be processed without undue delay and shall be subject to human review by a trusted third party designated by the Member States. Right holder’s shall incur liability for any unjustified use of the measures referred to in paragraph 1, and the dismissal of complaints shall be motivated.

      Moreover, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, Directive 2002/58/EC, Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 19 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Charter, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall only require the identification of individual users, and the processing of their personal data, to the strict extent necessary for the proper functioning of the complaints and redress mechanism referred to in this paragraph. Once a complaint has been definitively resolved under the complaints and redress mechanism, the personal data related to that complaint shall be deleted. Member States shall also ensure that, in the context of the application of the measures referred to in paragraph 1, users have access to a court or another relevant judicial authority to assert the use of an exception or limitation to copyright rules.

3. Member states shall facilitate, where necessary, the cooperation between the online content sharing service providers, users and right holders through stakeholder dialogues to agree criteria for determining whether the measures relating to unlicensed works and other subject matter referred to in paragraph 1 are appropriate and proportionate, taking into account, for example, the nature and size of the services, the number of works or the amount of other subject matter available on the service, the availability of technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments.
