1. Where information society service providers offer users content storage services and provide the public with access to content and where such activity is not eligible for the liability exemptions provided for in Directive 2000/31/EC, they shall take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure the functioning of licensing agreements concluded with rightholders. The implementation of such agreements shall respect the fundamental rights of users and shall not impose a general obligation on information society service providers to monitor the information which they transmit or store, in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC.

    1a. For the purpose of ensuring the functioning of licensing agreements, as referred to in paragraph 1, information society service providers and rightholders shall cooperate with each other. Rightholders shall accurately identify to information society service providers the works or other subject-matter in respect of which they have the copyright. The information society service providers shall inform rightholders of the measures employed and the accuracy of their functioning as well as, when relevant, periodically report on the use of the works and other subject-matter.

2. Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 in cooperation with rightholders put in place complaints mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the implementation of the licensing agreements referred to in paragraph 1.

    2a. Member States shall ensure that users have access to a court or another competent authority for the purpose of asserting their right of use under an exception or limitation and to appeal any restrictive measures agreed upon pursuant to paragraph 3.

3. Member States shall facilitate, where appropriate, the cooperation between the information society service providers referred to in paragraph 1, user representatives and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices for the implementation of paragraph 1. The measures undertaken shall be appropriate and proportionate and shall take into account, among others, the nature of the services, the availability of the technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments.
