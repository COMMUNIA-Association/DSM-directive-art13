## Article 2 Definitions

(4a) 'digital content platform' means an information society service as defined in Article 2(a) of Directive 2000/31/EC, the principal purpose of which is to provide the general public, via electronic communications networks within the meaning of point (a) of Article 2 of Directive 2002/21/EC, with a significant amount of user-generated content, copyright-protected works or other subject-matter uploaded or displayed by its users, with or without the consent or knowledge of rightholders, for the purposes of information, entertainment or education.

## 13 Use of protected content by digital content platform providers

1. Digital content platform providers shall enter into a fair licensing agreement with any requesting rightholder, provided that the category of works covered by the rightholder represents a significant amount of the content displayed on the platform. Under the terms of the agreement concluded with rightholders, digital content platform providers shall take measures to ensure the functioning of these agreements concluded with rightholders for the use of their works or other subject-matter or to prevent the availability on their services of works or other subject-matter identified by rightholders through the cooperation with the platform providers or to authorise by default all content uploaded by a user specified at any point by the rightholder. Those measures, such as the use of effective content recognition technologies, shall be appropriate and proportionate. The platform providers shall provide rightholders with adequate information on the functioning and the deployment of the measures, as well as, when relevant, adequate reporting on the recognition and use of the works and other subject-matter. Rightholders shall provide the platform provider with the relevant and necessary elements to ensure the proper functioning of the measures deployed by the provider in application of this Article.

2. Member States shall ensure that platform providers referred to in paragraph 1 put in place complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the application of the measures referred to in paragraph 1, in particular regarding the possible application of an exception or limitation to the content concerned. When such a mechanism is activated, any remuneration accruing from the disputed content during the course of the procedure shall not be distributed to either party until such time as the dispute has been resolved under the mechanism.

2a. The complaints and redress mechanism established pursuant to the first subparagraph shall ensure that users have access to sufficient information on the relevant exceptions and limitations that may apply to content affected by the measures referred to in paragraph 1. 

Any complaint filed under the mechanism shall be processed by the relevant rightholder within a reasonable period of time. The rightholder shall duly justify its decision.

3. Member States shall facilitate, where appropriate, cooperation between the digital content platform providers and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices, such as appropriate and proportionate content recognition technologies, taking into account, inter alia, the nature of the services, the availability of the technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments. In cooperation with the Member States, the Commission shall encourage the exchange of best practices across the Union regarding the results of any cooperation established pursuant to this Article.

3a. Member States shall provide that disputes between rightholders and digital content platform providers concerning the application of paragraph 1 of this Article may be submitted to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Member States shall create or designate an impartial body with relevant expertise to assist the parties in the resolution of their dispute under the mechanism provided for in the first subparagrah.
No later than [date mentioned in Article 21(1)] Member States shall notify to the Commission the body referred to in subparagraph 2.
