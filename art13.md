## 13 Use of protected content by information society service providers storing and/or giving access to significant amounts of works and other subject-matter uploaded by their users

1. Information society service providers that store and/or provide to the public access to copyright-protected works or other subject-matter uploaded by their users, thereby going beyond the mere provision of physical facilities and performing an act of communication to the public, shall conclude fair and balanced licensing agreements with any requesting rightholders. Under the terms of the agreements, such service providers shall, in cooperation with rightholders, take measures to ensure the effective and transparent functioning of the agreements concluded with rightholders for the use of their works or other subject-matter.

    Where, in the absence of a request from the rightholder, no licensing agreements are concluded pursuant to the first subparagraph, or where information society service providers that store significant amounts of copyright- protected works or other subject-matter and/or provide to the public access thereto are eligible for the liability exemption provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC, those providers shall take measures to prevent the availability on their services of works or other subject- matter identified by rightholders through the cooperation with the service providers.

    Those measures, such as the use of effective content recognition technologies, shall be appropriate, proportionate and compliant with the relevant industry standards. The service providers shall provide rightholders with adequate and timely information on the functioning and the deployment of the measures, as well as, when relevant, adequate reporting on the recognition and use of the rightholdersâ€™ works and other subject-matter. Rightholders shall provide the information society service provider with the relevant and necessary data to allow the effective functioning of the measures deployed by the provider in accordance with this Article.

2. Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 put in place effective mechanisms for rightholders to request licences and complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the application of the measures referred to in paragraph 1, in particular regarding the possible application of an exception or limitation to any rights covering the content concerned. When such a mechanism is activated, any remuneration accruing from the disputed content during the course of the procedure shall not be distributed to either party until such time as the dispute has been resolved under the mechanism.

    2a. The complaints and redress mechanism established pursuant to the first subparagraph shall ensure that users and rightholders have access to sufficient information on the relevant exceptions and limitations that may apply in relation to content affected by the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

    2b. Any complaint filed by a user under the mechanism referred to in the first subparagraph shall be processed by the relevant rightholder within a reasonable period of time. The rightholder shall duly justify his or her decision with regard to the complaint.

    2c. Where information society providers take the measures referred to in paragraph 1, such measures shall be in full compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC. Measures to prevent the unauthorised making available of copyright-protected works or other subject-matter shall be limited to specifically identified and duly notified works and shall not involve active monitoring of the entire data of each user of the service.

3. Member States shall facilitate, where appropriate, the cooperation between the information society service providers and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices, such as appropriate and proportionate content recognition technologies, taking into account, inter alia, the nature of the services, the availability and affordability of the technologies and their effectiveness in respect of the range of types of content and in light of technological developments. In cooperation with the Member States, the Commission shall encourage the exchange of best practice across the Union regarding the results of any cooperation established pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.

    3a. Member States shall encourage industry- led solutions to address sector-specific issues and the effective enforcement of existing measures to tackle piracy, including raising awareness of legal means of accessing copyright-protected works or other subject-matter.

    3b. Member States shall provide that disputes between rightholders and information society providers concerning the application of paragraph 1 of this Article may be submitted to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.

    Member States shall create or designate an impartial body with relevant expertise to assist the parties in the resolution of their dispute under the mechanism provided for in the first subparagraph.

    No later than ... [date mentioned in Article 21(1)] Member States shall notify to the Commission the body referred to in subparagraph 2.
