## 13 Use of protected content by information society service providers storing and giving access to large amounts of works and other subject-matter uploaded by their users

1. Information society service providers that store and provide to the public access to large amounts of protected works and other subject-matter uploaded by their users which the service providers organise and promote for profit-making purposes shall:

      (a) be obliged to enter into licensing agreements with requesting rightholders for uses of their protected works that conflict with the normal exploitation thereof;

      (b) provide requesting rightholders all information about user uploaded content made publicly accessible on the service through dedicated automated communication channels, so that the rightholders can inspect the uploaded content and, using the same channels, directly claim recognised copyrighted works and request removal or de-listing in accordance with paragraph 3.

      The costs arising from the inspection shall be borne by the service providers.

2. Member States shall provide for an exception or limitation to Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC for works uploaded by the users if these users do not act for commercial purposes and are not the rightholder or his or her representative. In the case of the absence of an agreement with a rightholder, revenue generated from the availability of the work on the service after it has been made available shall be awarded to the confirmed rightholder through a licensing agreement with the respective collecting society representing that type of author. The first sentence of Article 13(2) shall not apply, if the uploaded work is the original unmodified and unabridged version of the work.

3. To ensure that the measures provided for in paragraph 1 are effective and proportionate and without prejudice to exceptions and limitations to copyright and to freedom of expression, complaints and redress mechanisms shall be put in place. Those mechanisms shall ensure that:

      (a) rightholders are able to automatically report exact and complete matches of uses of protected works for monetisation or removal to the service providers using web-based automated communication (application programming interfaces);

      (b) rightholders furthermore have the right to request an expeditious de-listing from search results of uploads that are exact and complete matches of protected works available in wholesale, even during the removal dispute period;

      (c) where the rightholder requests the removal of copyrighted content, the uploader should have a fixed period of time, but no less than 48 hours, to respond to the request. During that period the content shall remain available online, notwithstanding potential delisting pursuant to point (b) above. The uploader shall receive an explanation of the request and a list of possible defences that puts them into a position where they can easily challenge the request if appropriate;

      (d) Member States shall provide a mechanism to resolve disputes, for example by appointing an independent third party, that allows uploaders and rightholders to challenge the decision by the service provider;

      (e) The service providers or the independent third party appointed by the Member State shall exclude from the reporting mechanisms described in this paragraph, for a limited period of time, individual rightholders or their representatives who submit requests obviously abusively or in a high number of unsuccessful cases.

      3a. Member states shall facilitate where appropriate, the cooperation between the information society service providers, rightholders and usersâ€™ representatives through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices.

      3b The service providers and rightholders shall publish aggregated statistical data about their interaction, such as the number of removal requests and the number of complaints and redress procedures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3.
